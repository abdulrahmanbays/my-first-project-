    Kobe Bryant spent his early years in Italy and joined the NBA 
    straight out of high school. A dominant scorer, Bryant won five NBA 
    championships and the 2008 MVP Award with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
    Although later seasons were marred by injuries, he surpassed Michael
     Jordan for third place on the NBA all-time scoring list in December 
     2014 and retired in 2016 after scoring 60 points in his final game.
      In 2018, Bryant earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film
       for Dear Basketball. On January 26, 2020, he was in a helicopter 
       crash that killed Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gigi and seven others.

<h3> NBA carrer and stats</h3>
<p>
    In his second season with the Lakers, Bryant was voted a starter for 
    the 1998 All-Star Game, becoming the youngest All-Star in NBA history
     at 19. The shooting guard then teamed up with superstar center Shaquille
      O'Neal to win three consecutive NBA championships and was voted 
      first-team all-NBA from 2002-2004. He also inked multi-year
       endorsement deals with Adidas, Sprite and other top sponsors.
</p>
<p> 
    Although the Lakers struggled after O'Neal left in 2004, Bryant
     performed brilliantly. He scored 81 points against the Toronto
      Raptors in January 2006, the second-highest single-game mark 
      in NBA history, and led the league in scoring that year and the next.
</p>
<p>
    In 2008, Bryant was named Most Valuable Player and carried his team 
    to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics. 
    In the 2009 NBA Finals, the Lakers beat the Orlando Magic to win 
    the championship. Shortly afterward, Bryant was part of the memorial 
    service to honor friend and music superstar Michael Jackson.
     The following year, the Lakers won their second straight title
      by defeating the Celtics.
